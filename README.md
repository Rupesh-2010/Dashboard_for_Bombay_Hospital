🏥 Bombay Hospital Dashboard Analysis (Power BI Project)
📖 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Hospital Performance Dashboard developed using Power BI.
The objective of this analysis is to convert raw hospital operational data into meaningful insights that support better decision-making for hospital management.

The dashboard helps administrators monitor patient flow, departmental workload, doctor utilization, and overall hospital performance in a simple visual format.

🎯 Business Objective

Hospitals handle large amounts of patient and operational data daily. Without proper analysis, management cannot efficiently allocate staff, plan resources, or identify performance gaps.

This project answers key business questions:

Which department receives the highest number of patients?

What are peak admission periods?

Which doctors handle the most cases?

How is hospital workload distributed?

How can management improve operational efficiency?
